to luanch the backend service
-The database was hosted on MongoDB(The Cloud-Native Database) atlas and for the sack of demo, the atlas was configured to allow all client to connect to the database.
-I used express framework and i am using mongoose to connect and perform CRUDAL operation
--To run the service, below are the commands, we export the securekey so the application can use the key for encryption and decryption of requests and responses using jwt
   --run : npm i
   --run command : export ccms_jwtPrivateKey =mySecureKey
   --then run : expo start

the source code is also uploaded to my github account : https://github.com/Adebusy/ccmsmobwebservice.git
